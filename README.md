## Why I did this <a name="introduction"></a>
I always found synchrony quite fascinating. And I was in good company - as far back as 17-th century renowned Dutch mathematician [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens) was perplexed by the uncanny capacity of pendulum clocks to synchronize their swings. The motion of the two pendula was such that their periods were identical but their displacements were opposite in direction. Being a scientist he rejected the out-of-the-box explanation his age had to offer (clearly, devilsâ€™ work, consider consulting a priest or sprinkling your setup with holy water) and his inquiries into the topic gave birth to a whole new branch of physics. 
After numerous rearrangements to the setup, he figured out that the pendulum clocks can in fact interact, being both attached to the heavy navy beam, which held them in place. Vibrations caused by the pendulum movements could traverse the beam back and forth - this is known as weak coupling. Synchronization of this sort is quite ubiquitous in nature, yet models which describe it prove themselves to be especially hard to tackle, as one has to keep in mind too many changing variables - phase, amplitude *etcetera*. Not, that it is in principle impossible - but challenging, and you are not going to find any of this stuff here. Luckily for us, there is a considerably simpler model, known as the [phase model](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Phase_model), which omits a lot of complexity, while preserving the crux of the problem. This model could be used to describe the behavior of [2](#Two_oscillators) or [more](#paragraph1) weakly coupled oscillators.

## Two oscillators <a name="Two_oscillators"></a>
## Kuramoto Model 101 <a name="paragraph1"></a>
Let's briefly review the Kuramoto model

### Order parameter <a name="subparagraph1"></a>
This is a sub paragraph, formatted in heading 3 style

## Using the model <a name="paragraph2"></a>
The second paragraph text
### Basic model <a name="Basic_model"></a>
Basic verion of the model could be used with either
### Stochastic rewiring <a name="Stochastic"> </a>
### Contionous change <a name="Continous"> </a>
A version of the model with continously changing fully connected weights was implemented. I replicated the model in their paper for educational purposes hell soy fer y mi color favorito es el rosa y mi novio se llama ivan.
