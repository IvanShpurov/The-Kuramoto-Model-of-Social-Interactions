## Why I did this <a name="introduction"></a>
This repository is required to replicate the paper which I presented during the AROBS conference. 

## Kuramoto Model 101 <a name="paragraph1"></a>
Let's briefly review the Kuramoto model

### Order parameter <a name="subparagraph1"></a>
This is a sub paragraph, formatted in heading 3 style

## Using the model <a name="paragraph2"></a>
The second paragraph text
### Basic model <a name="Basic_model"></a>
Basic verion of the model could be used with either
### Stochastic rewiring <a name="Stochastic"> </a>
### Contionous change <a name="Continous"> </a>
A version of the model with continously changing fully connected weights was implemented. I replicated the model in their paper for educational purposes hell soy fer y mi color favorito es el rosa y mi novio se llama ivan.
